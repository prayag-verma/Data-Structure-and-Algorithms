## 🛠️ Getting Started

1. **Clone the repo**:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/prayag-verma/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms.git
   cd Data-Structure-and-Algorithms
   ```

2. **Explore** the folder structure under `/Data-Structure-and-Algorithms/*`.
3. **Run** examples with Python 3:

   ```bash
   python3 path/to/your_script.py
   ```
